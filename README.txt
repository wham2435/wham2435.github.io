When I first started programming I knew I wanted to code a game but I wasn't sure where to start.  I took the javascript course on Codecademy to learn
some sintax and get used to the coding language but qickly moved on to Flash.  Flash was a good program to start with because the coding 
language (Action Script 3.0) was very similar to javascript but made it easier to integrate vector graphics into the game.  It took me a
while to get used to the specific coding for Flash but once I got it to work it was very straight forward.  I started out by following an
as3 tutorial on as3gametuts.com and I created a pong game with several different levels each with a different change and ending with a 
boss fight.  I had some issues when I tried to move the game from being wirtten in frames to written in seperate as3 files but with a few
small changes to the code I was able to fix it.  

After 5 levels and a boss fight I decided to move on to another game.  I tried a couple of different things before I settled on a 
platformer such as a sidescrolling beat-em-up and a top down shooter.  I managed to make some cool animations for the beat-em-up and that 
got me used to working with different frames in Flash.

When I finally settled on making a platformer my character was a green rectangle and I just stuck with it through the end but gave it a
face and made it purple.  I had a lot of issues with getting different parts of the game to communicate in the way I wanted such as
making the character detect if it's hitting the spikes or if all the flags are collected to open the portal.  Some problems I was stuck on
for weeks before I finally came to the realization as to how to fix it.  Importing elements was a whole other issue.  Flash has a hard
time dealing with PNG images and when those are imported it sometimes corrupts the whole .fla file leading to a lot of recovering backups
before I figured out what was going on.  One of the final problems I had with the game was implementing music.  I tried importing the
music as both .mp3 and .wav but they both had their own host of issues as well as making the game file too big.  Git Hub will only let you
upload files less than 25 Megabytes and all of the music in the game made the file well over 300 MB.  To solve this problem I uploaded all
the music seperately and just referenced the outside files from in the script.

It was a lot of fun working through different projects and having that "Ah-ha!" moment when you solve a problem after days and days of
trying.  It's also really gratifying to see other people play and enjoy your game.
